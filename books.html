Since her father's suicide, however, her sorceress stepmother and stepsisters have been intent on making her life worse. Reduced to the status of maid in her childhood home, the forlorn young woman is unable to acquire the magical attire required to attend the Sigillaria Ball and commune with the mysterious Orb, a sacred artifact of unknown origin and power. When the cryptic angel Thanatos appears and grants her the opportunity to attend the Ball, Cinderella takes it without considering the consequences. A tale told in a world crossed with cables, threatened by robot dragons, and built on elemental magic, Stephen Oravec's first novel revisits a timeless classic in a fantastical world unlike any other.",
